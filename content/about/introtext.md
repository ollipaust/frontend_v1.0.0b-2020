Thank you for browsing my website, I&apos;m so glad that you made
it here! I&apos;m Olliver, but you can call me Olli!
I&apos;m a passionate frontend web designer and coder by heart, specializing in animated, interactive
and responsive UX, UI and Content. I&apos;m using React as my framework of choice and Gatsby as static site generator.
Ever since I was a little kid I loved to be artsy and creative. More than 10 years ago I started to code my first
web sites with HTML &amp; CSS. After graduating school, I did an apprenticeship in Media Design at a Digital Agency.
Afterwards I&apos;ve been mostly working as a Webdesigner using WordPress. My dream is to work at an amazing Start-Up company
with an impactful product. Besides I&apos;m also very interested in entrepreneurship, tech and entertainment.
