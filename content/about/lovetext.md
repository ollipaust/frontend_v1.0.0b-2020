Sometimes it&apos;s easy to lose sight of the why of what we do. Maybe
we started off with inspiration and lost it somewhere along the way.
Because other things came up. Because life demanded it. Because money
was involved. Because we wanted to promote certain personal aspects.

This happened to me in my journey in IT and I feel that it&apos;s
important to reconnect with my &quot;why I do this&quot; and &quot;why I
started&quot;. I started creating web&shy;sites when I was a kid. I learned
coding through Forum-Softwares like MyBB in order to build a
board-system for my online gaming friends (guild) and ended up building
and hosting a forum with almost 5k users with topics ranging from games,
fun, technology and daily life.

What I love the most about websites and apps is that they are almost
all-encompassing, omniscient and omnipresent. It influences and affects
so many aspects in businesses and our personal lives. Whether you send a
letter to a loved one within a blink of an eye, connect with like-minded
people around the globe, who you&apos;d never get to meet otherwise or
share your art, thoughts, works, crafts or products.

What motivated me then was the same thing that motivates me today -
Creating something with a purpose. Fun. Play. I just want to create
something special. Something beautiful. Something that shows dedication
and mindfulness. And I find it truly amazing that everyone is able to
contribute to a things that billions of people use daily.
